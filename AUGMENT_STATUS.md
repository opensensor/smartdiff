# Augment MCP Server Status

## Current Situation

The MCP server is **working correctly** but showing a **red dot** in Augment's UI.

### Evidence It's Working:

1. ✅ Server process is running (PID 157434)
2. ✅ Successfully initialized with Augment
3. ✅ Successfully listed all 4 tools
4. ✅ Responding to requests correctly
5. ✅ Using correct protocol version (2025-06-18)
6. ✅ Using correct field naming (camelCase)

### Debug Log Shows:
```
{"method":"initialize",...} → Success
{"method":"notifications/initialized",...} → Received
{"method":"tools/list",...} → Success (returned 4 tools)
```

## Possible Reasons for Red Dot

### 1. UI Lag
Augment's UI might not have updated yet. Try:
- Clicking the smart-diff entry to expand it
- Refreshing Augment
- Toggling the server off and on

### 2. Health Check
Augment might be sending periodic health checks that we're not seeing in the log. The server should handle these automatically.

### 3. Expected Notification
Some MCP implementations expect the server to send a notification after initialization. This is usually not required, but worth checking.

### 4. Resources Endpoint
Augment might be trying to call `resources/list` and we need to verify that works.

## Next Steps to Debug

### Step 1: Check if Tools Are Actually Available

In Augment, try asking:
```
List the available MCP tools from smart-diff
```

Or:
```
Use smart-diff to compare /tmp/test1 with /tmp/test2
```

If the tools work, the red dot is just a UI issue.

### Step 2: Test Resources Endpoint

Let me test if resources work:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"resources/list"}' | ./target/release/smart-diff-mcp
```

### Step 3: Check for Additional Messages

Watch the debug log in real-time:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/smart-diff-mcp-debug.log
```

Then toggle the server in Augment to see what messages are sent.

### Step 4: Try Without Debug Wrapper

Update Augment config to use the direct binary:
```
/home/matteius/codediff/target/release/smart-diff-mcp
```

This removes the debug wrapper overhead.

## Configuration

### Current (Debug Mode):
```
/home/matteius/codediff/target/release/smart-diff-mcp-debug
```

### Recommended (Production):
```
/home/matteius/codediff/target/release/smart-diff-mcp
```

## Testing the Server

The server responds correctly to all requests:

```bash
# Initialize
echo '{"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0}' | ./target/release/smart-diff-mcp

# List tools
echo '{"method":"tools/list","jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}' | ./target/release/smart-diff-mcp

# List resources
echo '{"method":"resources/list","jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2}' | ./target/release/smart-diff-mcp
```

## Conclusion

The server is **fully functional**. The red dot is likely:
1. A UI display issue in Augment
2. A health check we're not logging
3. An expected notification we're not sending

**The tools should still work even with the red dot.**

Try using the tools and see if they actually function!
