### Quick Start
1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin smart-diff-server
   ```

2. **Open the Web UI**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

3. **Upload Files**:
   - Drag and drop files or directories into the upload zone
   - Or click "Select Directory" / "Select Files" to browse

4. **Parse and Analyze**:
   - Click "Parse All Files" to extract functions and metadata
   - View results in the interactive file tree and results grid

5. **Compare Files**:
   - Switch to the "Compare" tab
   - Select source and target files from parsed results
   - Configure comparison options and click "Compare Files"

6. **Run Analysis**:
   - Switch to the "Analysis" tab
   - Enable desired analysis options
   - Click "Run Analysis" for comprehensive insights

## üìã API Endpoints

The web UI integrates with the following API endpoints:

### Health Check
```
GET /api/health
```
Returns system status and component health information.

### File Comparison
```
POST /api/compare
```
Compare two files with detailed similarity analysis.

### Multi-file Analysis
```
POST /api/analyze
```
Analyze multiple files with cross-file detection and metrics.

### Configuration
```
POST /api/configure
```
Update system configuration settings.

## üéØ Use Cases

### Code Review
- Compare different versions of files to understand changes
- Identify potential issues and improvements
- Track code quality metrics over time

### Refactoring Analysis
- Detect duplicate code across the codebase
- Identify opportunities for code consolidation
- Measure complexity before and after refactoring

### Migration Planning
- Analyze legacy codebases for migration planning
- Understand code structure and dependencies
- Estimate migration effort and complexity

### Quality Assurance
- Monitor code quality metrics across projects
- Identify files with high complexity or duplication
- Track improvements over time

## üîß Configuration Options

### Parser Configuration
- **Max File Size**: Maximum file size to parse (default: 1MB)
- **Parse Timeout**: Timeout for parsing operations (default: 30s)
- **Error Recovery**: Enable error recovery during parsing

### Semantic Analysis
- **Resolution Depth**: Maximum depth for symbol resolution (default: 10)
- **Cross-file Analysis**: Enable analysis across multiple files
- **Symbol Cache Size**: Cache size for symbol table (default: 1000)

### Diff Engine

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not uploading**:
- Check file size limits in configuration
- Ensure files have supported extensions
- Verify browser supports File API

**Parsing failures**:
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- Try smaller files to isolate issues

**Slow performance**:
- Reduce file count or size
- Adjust parser timeout settings
- Check system resources

### Browser Compatibility
