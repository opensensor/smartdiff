# Graph Performance Improvements Summary

## Problem Statement

The D3 force-directed graph visualization was experiencing severe performance issues with large changesets:
- Nodes spreading infinitely far apart and moving off-screen
- Extremely slow rendering and interaction
- High CPU usage
- Poor user experience with 100+ function changes

## Root Causes

1. **Unbounded simulation** - No constraints on node positions
2. **O(n²) link creation** - Creating all-to-all links within file groups
3. **Fixed force parameters** - Same settings for all graph sizes
4. **No alpha decay optimization** - Simulation running indefinitely

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Adaptive Force Parameters
- Detect large graphs (>50 nodes)
- Reduce charge strength from -300 to -100 for large graphs
- Reduce link distance from 100 to 50 for large graphs
- Reduce collision radius from 30 to 20 for large graphs

### 2. Optimized Link Creation
- Small groups (≤10 nodes): Full mesh connectivity (O(n²))
- Large groups (>10 nodes): Chain connectivity (O(n))
- **Result**: 98% reduction in links for 100-node files

### 3. Boundary Constraints
- Constrain nodes to viewport with 50px padding
- Prevents nodes from drifting off-screen
- Maintains visibility of all nodes

### 4. Centering Forces
- Added weak X/Y centering forces (strength: 0.05)
- Prevents excessive spreading
- Keeps graph compact and viewable

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Faster alpha decay for large graphs (0.05 vs 0.0228)
- Distance limiting for charge forces (200px for large graphs)
- Increased velocity decay (0.4)
- Stronger collision detection (0.7)

## Performance Impact

### Before
- 50 nodes: Slow, nodes spread out
- 100 nodes: Very slow, nodes off-screen
- 200+ nodes: Unusable

### After
- 50 nodes: Fast, compact layout
- 100 nodes: Good performance, stays on-screen
- 200+ nodes: Usable, settles quickly

### Link Count Example (100 functions in one file)
- Before: 4,950 links
- After: 99 links
- Improvement: 98% reduction

## Files Modified

1. `nextjs-frontend/src/components/graph/FunctionGraphViewer.tsx`
2. `nextjs-frontend/src/components/graph/FunctionGraph.tsx`
3. `static/app.js`

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Load a comparison with 50+ function changes
2. Verify nodes stay within viewport
3. Check that simulation settles within 3-5 seconds
4. Confirm smooth interaction (zoom, pan, drag)
5. Monitor CPU usage (should drop after settling)

## Configuration

The large graph threshold can be adjusted:

```typescript
const isLargeGraph = nodeCount > 50; // Change this value as needed
```

## Next Steps

For even larger datasets (500+ nodes), consider:
- Progressive rendering
- WebGL-based rendering
- Automatic clustering
- Level-of-detail rendering
