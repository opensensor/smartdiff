# MCP Function Sorting - Improved

## Problem

The `list_changed_functions` tool was showing functions in a suboptimal order. All additions and deletions have a magnitude of 1.0, so they were appearing first, making it hard to find the most interesting changes (modified functions with actual code differences).

### Example of Old Behavior
```
Changed Functions (showing 50 of 693):

1. tx_isp_proc_w00_show - deleted (magnitude: 1.00, similarity: 0.00)
2. tx_isp_proc_w00_open - deleted (magnitude: 1.00, similarity: 0.00)
3. tx_isp_proc_w01_show - deleted (magnitude: 1.00, similarity: 0.00)
...
```

This made it difficult to find the most important changes - functions that were actually modified with varying degrees of change.

## Solution

Improved the sorting algorithm in `crates/mcp-server/src/comparison/context.rs` to prioritize by **change type** first, then by **magnitude** within each type:

### New Sorting Priority

1. **Modified functions** (sorted by magnitude, highest first)
   - These are the most interesting - actual code changes
   - Higher magnitude = more significant changes
   
2. **Added functions** (alphabetically)
   - New functionality added to the codebase
   
3. **Deleted functions** (alphabetically)
   - Functionality removed from the codebase
   
4. **Renamed/moved functions** (sorted by magnitude)
   - Structural changes with minimal code impact

### Implementation

```rust
/// Get functions sorted by change magnitude (most changed first)
/// 
/// Sorting priority:
/// 1. Modified functions (sorted by magnitude, highest first)
/// 2. Added functions (alphabetically)
/// 3. Deleted functions (alphabetically)
/// 4. Renamed/moved functions (sorted by magnitude)
pub fn get_sorted_changes(&self) -> Vec<FunctionChange> {
    let mut changes = self.function_changes.clone();
    changes.sort_by(|a, b| {
        // First, prioritize by change type
        let type_priority_a = Self::change_type_priority(&a.change_type);
        let type_priority_b = Self::change_type_priority(&b.change_type);
        
        match type_priority_a.cmp(&type_priority_b) {
            std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => {
                // Within same type, sort by magnitude (descending) then name
                match b.change_magnitude.partial_cmp(&a.change_magnitude) {
                    Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal) | None => {
                        a.function_name.cmp(&b.function_name)
                    }
                    Some(ordering) => ordering,
                }
            }
            ordering => ordering,
        }
    });
    changes
}

/// Get priority for change type (lower number = higher priority)
fn change_type_priority(change_type: &str) -> u8 {
    match change_type {
        "modified" => 0,  // Highest priority - actual code changes
        "added" => 1,     // New functionality
        "deleted" => 2,   // Removed functionality
        "renamed" => 3,   // Structural changes
        "moved" => 4,     // File reorganization
        _ => 5,           // Unknown types last
    }
}
```

## Example of New Behavior

```
Changed Functions (showing 5 of 5):

1. old_name - modified (magnitude: 0.26, similarity: 0.74)
   Source: test.c (lines 22-22)
   Target: test.c (lines 21-21)
   Summary: Function 'old_name' modified (similarity: 0.74)

2. heavily_modified - modified (magnitude: 0.08, similarity: 0.92)
   Source: test.c (lines 15-15)
   Target: test.c (lines 10-10)
   Summary: Function 'heavily_modified' modified (similarity: 0.92)

3. slightly_modified - modified (magnitude: 0.02, similarity: 0.98)
   Source: test.c (lines 9-9)
   Target: test.c (lines 4-4)
   Summary: Function 'slightly_modified' modified (similarity: 0.98)

4. added_function - added (magnitude: 1.00, similarity: 0.00)
   Target: test.c (lines 31-31)
   Summary: Function added

5. deleted_function - deleted (magnitude: 1.00, similarity: 0.00)
   Source: test.c (lines 4-4)
   Summary: Function deleted
```

## Benefits

✅ **Modified functions appear first** - The most interesting changes are immediately visible

✅ **Magnitude-based ranking within modified** - Functions with more significant changes appear higher

✅ **Logical grouping** - Similar change types are grouped together

✅ **Better UX for large codebases** - When you have 693 changes, you see the most important ones first

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:

```bash
./test_sorting_fix.sh
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Modified functions appear first (positions 1-3)
- ✅ Within modified, higher magnitude comes first (0.26 > 0.08 > 0.02)
- ✅ Added functions come next (position 4)
- ✅ Deleted functions come last (position 5)

## How to Apply

The fix has been applied and the server restarted:

1. ✅ Code updated in `crates/mcp-server/src/comparison/context.rs`
2. ✅ Binary rebuilt at `target/release/smart-diff-mcp`
3. ✅ MCP server restarted with new binary

The improved sorting is now active!

## Impact

- **No breaking changes** - The API remains the same
- **Better user experience** - Most relevant changes appear first
- **Scalable** - Works well with large numbers of changes (e.g., 693 functions)
- **Intuitive** - Matches developer expectations about what's "most changed"

## Use Cases

This improvement is especially valuable when:

1. **Reviewing large refactorings** - Modified functions with actual logic changes appear first
2. **Understanding impact** - See the most significant changes immediately
3. **Code review** - Focus on the functions that matter most
4. **Debugging** - Quickly identify functions with substantial changes

## Additional Notes

- The magnitude calculation for modified functions is: `1.0 - similarity_score`
- A similarity of 0.74 means 26% change (magnitude 0.26)
- A similarity of 0.98 means 2% change (magnitude 0.02)
- Additions and deletions always have magnitude 1.0 (complete change)
