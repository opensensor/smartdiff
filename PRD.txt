# Product Requirements Document
## Smart Code Diffing Tool

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Author:** Product Team

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for a next-generation code diffing tool that performs structural and semantic comparison of source code files. Unlike traditional line-based diff tools, this solution will understand code structure at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, enabling intelligent comparison of functions, classes, and other code elements regardless of their position in files.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Order Dependency**: Traditional diff tools (including Beyond Compare) compare files line-by-line, making them sensitive to code reorganization
2. **Noise from Formatting**: Whitespace changes, indentation, and code formatting create unnecessary diff noise
3. **Poor Refactoring Detection**: Moving or renaming functions/methods appears as deletions and additions rather than moves
4. **Limited Context Understanding**: Current tools don't understand the semantic meaning of code changes
5. **Cross-File Refactoring**: No ability to track code moved between files

### User Pain Points

- Developers spend excessive time reviewing cosmetic changes during code reviews
- Difficult to identify actual logic changes when code has been reformatted
- Merging becomes complex when team members reorganize code structure
- No way to compare code at the function/method level across different file versions

---

## Market Analysis

### Existing Solutions

Based on research, several products partially address this need:

1. **SemanticMerge (Unity/Plastic SCM)**
   - Performs structure-aware merge and diff for C#, VB.NET, Java, and C
   - Diffs code on a structural level rather than text positioning level
   - Can track methods moved between files
   - Now integrated into Unity Version Control

2. **SemanticDiff**
   - Language-aware diff for VS Code and GitHub
   - Filters out invariant changes (whitespace, optional parentheses)
   - Detects moved code and refactorings
   - Supports Python, Rust, Java, C#, TypeScript

3. **Diffsitter**
   - Tree-sitter based AST diff tool
   - Ignores formatting differences
   - Supports multiple languages through tree-sitter parsers

4. **Diff/AST (diffast)**
   - Compares ASTs node by node
   - Uses tree edit distance algorithms
   - Exports changes as XML or N-Triples

5. **Code Compare (Devart)**
   - Structure comparison mode for C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, Visual Basic, and XML
   - Integrates with Visual Studio

### Gap Analysis

While existing solutions provide AST-based comparison, they have limitations:
- Limited language support
- Poor handling of cross-file refactoring
- Lack of customizable comparison rules
- Limited integration with modern development workflows
- No unified solution that handles all major programming languages

---

## Product Vision

### Mission Statement
Build an intelligent, language-aware code diffing tool that understands code structure and semantics, enabling developers to focus on meaningful changes while ignoring cosmetic differences.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Universal Language Support**: Support for 20+ programming languages
2. **Intelligent Function Matching**: Advanced algorithms to match functions across files
3. **Customizable Rules**: User-defined rules for what constitutes a "meaningful" change
4. **IDE Integration**: Deep integration with major IDEs
5. **Performance**: Handle large codebases (100k+ files) efficiently

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Parser Engine
- **Multi-language Parser Framework**
  - Leverage tree-sitter for broad language support
  - Custom parsers for languages not supported by tree-sitter
  - Plugin architecture for adding new language support
  
- **AST Generation**
  - Convert source code to normalized AST representation
  - Store metadata (comments, formatting) separately
  - Support incremental parsing for performance

#### 2. Semantic Analysis Engine
- **Symbol Resolution**
  - Track variable and function declarations
  - Resolve references across files
  - Build dependency graphs

- **Type Information**
  - Extract and compare type signatures
  - Understand type equivalence (e.g., `int` vs `Int32`)

#### 3. Matching Algorithm
- **Function-Level Matching**
  ```
  Algorithm: Hierarchical Signature Matching
  1. Extract function signatures (name, parameters, return type)
  2. Calculate similarity scores using:
     - Signature similarity (weighted 40%)
     - Body similarity using AST edit distance (weighted 40%)
     - Context similarity (surrounding code) (weighted 20%)
  3. Apply Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching
  4. Handle many-to-many mappings for split/merged functions
  ```

- **Cross-File Tracking**
  - Maintain a global symbol table
  - Track moves between files
  - Detect file renames and splits

#### 4. Diff Computation Engine
- **Tree Edit Distance**
  - Implement optimized Zhang-Shasha algorithm
  - Use heuristics to prune search space
  - Cache intermediate results

- **Change Classification**
  - Categorize changes: move, rename, modify, add, delete
  - Detect refactoring patterns (extract method, inline, etc.)

#### 5. Presentation Layer
- **Multiple View Modes**
  - Traditional side-by-side view
  - Unified diff view
  - Structure view (showing code organization)
  - Function-centric view
