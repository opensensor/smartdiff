# Fix: Empty Files Showing in Filtered View

## Problem

When the "Modified" filter was active, some files marked as "unchanged" were still appearing in the file list with chevrons, even though they had no modified functions to display.

### Example from Screenshot:
- `tx_isp_missing_funcs.c` - marked "unchanged", showing with chevron
- `gc2053.c` - marked "unchanged", showing with chevron

These files would expand to show "No function matches found for current filter" message, which is confusing and clutters the UI.

## Root Cause

The code was pre-populating `filteredGroups` with ALL files from `fileChanges`, regardless of whether they had any function pairs matching the current filter:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - WRONG
fileChanges.forEach(fileChange => {
  const fileKey = filePath.split('/').pop() || filePath;
  
  // This added EVERY file to filteredGroups, even if it has no matching functions
  if (!filteredGroups.has(fileKey)) {
    filteredGroups.set(fileKey, []);  // Empty array for all files
  }
  
  statusMap.set(fileKey, {...});
});

// Then later, function pairs were added
filtered.forEach(pair => {
  filteredGroups.get(fileKey)!.push(pair);
});
```

This meant:
1. All files got added to `filteredGroups` with empty arrays
2. Only files with matching functions got pairs added
3. Files with no matching functions remained in `filteredGroups` with empty arrays
4. The empty filtering at the end tried to remove them, but there was a logic issue

## Solution

Changed the logic to only add files to `filteredGroups` if they actually have function pairs after filtering:

```typescript
// NEW CODE - CORRECT
// Build statusMap for all files (for reference/metadata)
fileChanges.forEach(fileChange => {
  const fileKey = filePath.split('/').pop() || filePath;
  statusMap.set(fileKey, {
    ...fileChange,
    functionCount: actualCount
  });
});

// Only add files to filteredGroups if they have function pairs
filtered.forEach(pair => {
  const fileKey = fileName.split('/').pop() || fileName;
  
  // This creates the entry ONLY when there's a pair to add
  if (!filteredGroups.has(fileKey)) {
    filteredGroups.set(fileKey, []);
  }
  
  filteredGroups.get(fileKey)!.push(pair);
});
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `nextjs-frontend/src/components/diff/BeyondCompareFunctionDiff.tsx`

1. **Removed pre-population of filteredGroups** (lines 573-579 in old code)
   - No longer adds all files upfront
   - Files are only added when they have function pairs

2. **Kept statusMap population** (lines 571-583 in new code)
   - Still builds metadata for all files
   - Used for displaying file badges and counts
   - But doesn't affect which files are shown

3. **Removed redundant empty filtering** (lines 619-625 in old code)
   - No longer needed since we only add files with pairs
   - Simplified the code

## Result

### Before:
- ❌ Files with no matching functions appeared in the list
- ❌ Clicking chevron showed "No function matches found" message
- ❌ Cluttered UI with irrelevant files

### After:
- ✅ Only files with matching functions appear in the list
- ✅ Every file shown has at least one function to display
- ✅ Clean, focused UI

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Set filter to "Modified"**
   - Should only show files that have modified functions
   - Files with only unchanged functions should not appear

2. **Set filter to "All"**
   - Should show all files with any functions
   - Files with no functions at all should still not appear

3. **Set filter to "Unchanged"**
   - Should only show files with unchanged functions
   - Files with only modified functions should not appear

4. **Expand any file**
   - Should always show function list (never "No function matches found")
   - Every visible file has content to display

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **File marked "unchanged" but has modified functions**
   - File status badge shows "unchanged" (file-level metadata)
   - File appears in list when "Modified" filter is active
   - Shows the modified functions inside

2. **File marked "modified" but all functions are unchanged**
   - File does NOT appear when "Modified" filter is active
   - File appears when "Unchanged" or "All" filter is active

3. **File with no functions at all**
   - Never appears in any filter view
   - Doesn't clutter the UI

## Benefits

- ✅ **Cleaner UI** - No empty files shown
- ✅ **Less confusion** - Every file has content when expanded
- ✅ **Better performance** - Fewer DOM elements to render
- ✅ **Simpler code** - Removed redundant empty filtering logic
